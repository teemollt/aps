# Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
# It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays,
# according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. For this reason, it is sometimes called partition-exchange sort.
# Best-case performance: O(n log n)
# Worst-case space complexity: O(n)
